Romain Guy Muzei
================

**Romain Guy Muzei** is An artwork source for Roman Nurik's [muzei](http://muzei.co) that displays random pictures from
Romain Guy's [Flickr photostream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/romainguy/).

Romain's photos are freely available for non-commercial projects (such as this one).

## What's there and what's coming

The app simply scraps the last 100 photos published on Romain's flickr account. It then picks
one at random and downloads it at the highest possible resolution (hmmm, pixels...).

These things are slated for later releases:
- Add a settings screen (update interval, select album, whatever)
- Cache downloaded photos locally to save on bandwidth
- Optionally only download new pics or update the photostream on Wi-Fi

## Download
You can download **Romain Guy Muzei** from the Google Play Store:
